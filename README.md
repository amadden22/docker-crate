# What Is CrateDB?

CrateDB is an open source, distributed SQL database with integrated search that makes it simple to store and analyze massive amounts of structured and unstructured data in real-time. A shared-nothing architecture and automatic data sharding  & rebalancing make it easy to scale out a highly available CrateDB cluster to handle more data, more queries or more users.
CrateDB is ideal for machine data. It's able to ingest millions of sensor readings or log entries per second and query them at in-memory speed using the same SQL syntax that already exists in your applications and BI tools. An advanced distributed query engine enables CrateDB to perform joins, sub-selects,, aggregations and even ad hoc queries at high speed.
CrateDB provides several installation packages, including a supported Docker image. It fits perfectly into an orchestrated microservices environment, providing a scalable, containerized persistence layer that scales along with your app containers. CrateDB clusters can be supervised with an interactive database administration tool.

# Quick Start Example: Multihost Production Setup

This is an example configuration to run in a multi-host production environment.
The configuration includes the required minimum settings:
 - Volume mapping
 - Port mapping to localhost (run only one container per machine)
 - Unicast host discovery

To start the CrateDB cluster in containers distributed to three hosts without
multicast enabled, run this command on the first node and adapt the container
and node names on the two other nodes:

```console
# HOSTS="crate1.example.com:4300,crate2.example.com:4300,crate3.example.com:4300"
# HOST="crate1.example.com"
# docker run -d -p 4200:4200 -p 4300:4300 \
    --name crate1-container \
    --volume /mnt/data:/data \
    --ulimit nofile=65535 \
    --ulimit memlock=9223372036854775807 \
    --env CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=8g \
        crate/crate:latest \
        crate \
          -Des.cluster.name=crate-cluster \
          -Des.node.name=crate1 \
          -Des.transport.publish_port=4300 \
          -Des.network.publish_host="$HOST" \
          -Des.multicast.enabled=false \
          -Des.discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts="$HOSTS" \
          -Des.discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes=2
```

# The crate/crate Docker Image

To form a cluster from scratch, start a few instances of the CrateDB container as a background
daemon:

```console
# docker run -d crate/crate
```

To access the admin UI, map port 4200 and point your browser to port tcp/4200 of
a node of your choice while you start it or look up its IP later:

```console
# firefox "http://$(docker inspect --format='{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}' $(docker run -d crate/crate)):4200/admin"
```

For production use it's strongly recommended to use only one container per
machine. This will give the best possible performance, and by mapping
the ports from the Docker container to the host, it acts like a native
installation. CrateDB's default ports 4200 (HTTP), 4300 (Transport protocol) and 5432 (Postgres wire protocol).

```console
# docker run -d -p 4200:4200 -p 4300:4300 -p 5432:5432 crate/crate
```

## Attach Persistent Data Directory

CrateDB stores all important data in _/data_. It's advised to mount this
directory to avoid writing within the Docker image:

```console
# docker run -d -v <data-dir>:/data crate/crate
```

## Use Custom CrateDB Configuration

Starting with release 0.55.0, CrateDB no longer supports providing custom
configuration files. However it is still possible to mount CrateDB's configuration
into `/config/crate.yml`.

```console
# docker run -d -v <custom/config/path>/crate.yml:/config/crate.yml crate/crate
```


For further configuration options refer to the
[Configuration](https://crate.io/docs/stable/configuration.html) section of our
documentation.

## Environment

CrateDB recognizes environment variables like `CRATE_HEAP_SIZE` that need to be
set with the `--env` option before the actual CrateDB core starts. You may want to
[assign about half of your memory
it](https://crate.io/docs/reference/en/latest/configuration.html#crate-heap-size)
to CrateDB as a rule of thumb:

```console
# docker run -d --env CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=32g crate/crate
```

## Open Files

Depending on the size of your installation, CrateDB can open a lot of files. You
can check the number of open files with `ulimit -n`, but it can depend on your
host operating system. To increase the number, start containers with the option
`--ulimit nofile=65535`. Furthermore it is recommended to set the `memlock` limit
(the maximum locked-in-memory address space) to unlimited by setting it to a
very high number (Docker requires a 64 bit integer) `--ulimit memlock=9223372036854775807`.

## Multicast

By Default, CrateDB uses multicast for node discovery. This means nodes started in
the same multicast zone will discover each other automatically. Docker multicast
support between containers on different hosts depends on an overlay network
driver. If that does not support multicast, you have to [enable unicast in a
custom
_crate.yml_](https://crate.io/docs/reference/best_practice/multi_node_setup.html)
file.

CrateDB publishes the hostname it runs on for discovery within the cluster. If the
address of the docker container differs from the actual host the docker image is
running on, this is the case if you do port mapping to the host via the `-p`
option, you need to tell CrateDB to publish the address of the docker host
instead:

```console
# docker run -d -p 4200:4200 -p 4300:4300 \
    crate/crate -Des.network.publish_host=host1.example.com
```

If you change the transport port from the default `4300` to something else, you
need to pass the publish port to CrateDB by adding
`-Des.transport.publish_port=4321` to your command.

## CrateDB Shell

The CrateDB Shell `crash` is bundled with the Docker image. Since the `crash`
executable is already in the `$PATH` environment variable, simply run:

```console
# docker run --rm -ti crate/crate crash --hosts [host1, host2, ...]
```
